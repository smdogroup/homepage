Sean Engelstad is a Ph.D. student in Aerospace Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he 
received his B.S. in AE as well.  Sean has interned at the Aerospace Corporation the past two summers, working on 
design curves for unvented sandwich structures, a methodology for the treatment of pressure transients in space systems,
and machine learning for valve failures in fluid systems.  As a part of the SMDO group, Sean is working on adding 
mesh sensivitity to the SMDO team's structural optimization software, using Engineering Sketch Pad, ESP/CAPs. He is a member of the 
development team for FUNtoFEM, the group's interface for coupled aerothermoelastic analysis, design, and optimization.
With mesh sensivities available, optimized solutions can be parameterized as a function of global or local mesh parameters
easily.
