- **[10/2023]:** Our paper [Topology Optimization Using an Eigenvector Aggregate](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00158-023-03674-x) is now published in *Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization*! We present an innovative eigenvector aggregate, based on the first N eigenvalues and eigenvectors, to streamline displacement and stress constraint implementation in topology optimization. Access the code [here](https://github.com/smdogroup/eigenvector-aggregate) for practical application.
