abstract = {Structural engineers are often constrained by cost or manufacturing considerations to select member thicknesses from a discrete set of values. Conventional, gradient-free techniques to solve these discrete problems cannot handle large problem sizes, while discrete material optimization (DMO) techniques may encounter difficulties, especially for bending-dominated problems. To resolve these issues, we propose an efficient gradient-based technique to obtain engineering solutions to the discrete thickness selection problem. The proposed technique uses a series of constraints to enforce an effective stiffness-to-mass and strength-to-mass penalty on intermediate designs. In conjunction with these constraints, we apply an exact penalty function which drives the solution towards a discrete design. We utilize a continuation approach to obtain approximate solutions to the discrete thickness selection problem by solving a sequence of relaxed continuous problems with increasing penalization. We also show how this approach can be applied to combined discrete thickness selection and topology optimization design problems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique, we present both compliance and stress-constrained results for in-plane and bending-dominated problems.},

abstract = {Many constraints in design-optimization problems take the form of bounds on a physical quantity over a domain. These infinite-dimensional constraints are often addressed through aggregation methods that approximate the bound in a differentiable manner. However, the most common constraint-aggregation methods exhibit mesh dependence; as the mesh spacing decreases, the aggregation function diverges. In addition, there are no established methods to assess the impact of constraint aggregation on the optimized design. To address these deficiencies, we propose a new class of constraint-aggregation method that we call induced aggregates. We examine the properties of these aggregation methods, describe their numerical implementation, and test their numerical accuracy on a pressure-loaded circular cylinder test case. Furthermore, we propose a post-optimality estimation technique to assess the impact of the constraint-aggregation method on the design. We use this method to examine the optimized mass obtained from two stress-constrained mass minimization problems: a variable-thickness sheet problem and a wingbox design problem.},

In this paper, we present strategies to adaptively solve aggregation-constrained problems. These adaptive techniques achieve a tighter bound approximation while also reducing the computational cost of optimization. We focus on two aggregation techniques: Kreisselmeier–Steinhauser (KS) aggregation, and induced exponential aggregation. We demonstrate that the proposed adaptive technique achieves significant computational savings compared to fixed-aggregation methods for a series of stress-constrained mass-minimization problems.},
