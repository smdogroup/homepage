   contain the root `toctree` directive.

.. the structure should be as follows:
   homepage

Welcome to the website for Professor Graeme Kennedy’s research group in
the School of Aerospace Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
Our group’s research is focused both on the development of new methods 
for structural and multidisciplinary optimization and the application 
of these methods to structural and multidisciplinary design problems. 
We have been working on developing and applying novel design 
optimization algorithms for:

- Large-scale topology optimization
- Aeroelastic optimization of flexible aircraft and rotorcraft
- Optimization of composite structures
